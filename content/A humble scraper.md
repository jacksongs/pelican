Summary: Here's a real-life python scraper to collect South Australian government contract data. 

Here's something I put together today at work. It grabs all the contracts listed on the [www.tenders.sa.gov.au](http://www.tenders.sa.gov.au) website.

It took about 30 minutes to write. I hit some trouble with some unanticipated blank spots. Ultimately it ran through in a couple of hours, as you can see from the times listed.
