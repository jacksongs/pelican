Title: About Jackson

I'm a data journalist working for the Adelaide Advertiser based in Canberra. 

That means I do a [bit of federal politics](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/treasurer-joes-hockey-confirms-pension-age-rises-to-70-for-those-born-after-1965/story-fni6uo1m-1226903894804), but mostly data-heavy stories like [this one about speed cameras](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/none-of-adelaides-top-10-speed-camera-locations-in-2014-are-on-the-states-black-spot-program/story-fni6uo1m-1226909582332), [this one fact checking the state government's tourism numbers](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/tourdownunder/tour-down-under-tourist-numbers-in-spotlight-with-abs-statistics-failing-to-support-government-figures/story-fnkqpwk5-1226810893442) or [this unemployment yarn with a tasty embed](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/sas-unemployment-rate-for-april-drops-08-per-cent-down-from-12year-high/story-fni6uo1m-1226910164753).

What I really love are new opportunities in media. 

I relish scraping data from websites, to do things like [finding out the differences in childcare costs across the country](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/childcare-costs-keep-nsw-mums-out-of-the-workforce/story-fni0cx12-1226682492393).

And you'll often catch me building fantasy football websites. Or playing with Twitter's Streaming API. Or sharing near-real-time sports highlights either manually...

...or programmatically (stay tuned).
