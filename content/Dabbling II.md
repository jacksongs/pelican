Summary: Notes and reflections from the first lecture in the CS109 Harvard data science course.

*Never stop learning is a motto of mine. [Here](/dabbling-in-data-science.html) it's data science, and [Harvard's CS109 data science course](http://cs109.org/).*

Week 1 lecture notes - [video link](http://cm.dce.harvard.edu/2014/01/14328/L01/index_H264SingleHighBandwidth-16x9.shtml)
====================

Here are some notes from the first week lecture video.

0:40 - Joe Blitzstein gets an ovation from the students. I Google Joe. I still don't get it. Then he mentions Nate Silver. I've read The Signal and the Noise. I can't remember Joe.

5:00 - Discussing human elements and visualisation. This appeals to me more than the predictive modelling.

6:10 - The cross-disciplinary nature of data science is exciting.

7:30 - Shlomo Aragmon quote is pretty good. Must Google that guy too.

7:50 - Nate Silver. Yeah, yeah.

12:20 - William Chen. He must be famous (must Google).

14:15 - "Real data are...". Mmmm. Still not convinced.

15:50 - Wouldn't mind seeing a chart of Nate Silver references in this lecture. I hope this is the high point.

17:15 - "Prediction is hard, especially about the future." Heh.

19:00 - Joe's stutter is gone.

25:37 - The sequencing chart is pretty amazing. Unfortunately I know nothing about sequencing.

28:20 - Netflix recommendation engine contest. I'm not necessarily convinced about the obsession around recommendations in media today. But that's for another time.

31:00 - "How good is this?" Measuring success in data science is difficult. Sounds like swagger might have some significance.

33:00 - Curse of dimensionality sounds like a good script.

35:30 - 10% on Netflix prize... conspiracy?

36:30 - Ramon y Cajal drawings are amazing.

40:00~ - Yeah that brain stuff was pretty extraordinary. Data science seems to only be a very small part of that though.

43:20 - Diagram linking substantive expertise with computer science and statistics is important. Data insights are dependent on close proximity to specialists.

54:00 - Jim Gray's Fourth Paradigm. Doesn't sound particularly interesting.

56:00 - Hal Varian's thoughts seem more interesting. I agree with his comments around the need to be able to interpret data and communicate insights derived from data.

57:40 - The process: Ask, get, explore, model, communicate. AGEMC! Ask, get, explore, model, communicate. AGEMC!

58:00 - This data science process mimics journalistic inquiry. 

1:03:00 - Hanspeter. CS171 visualisation course sounds tasty.

1:05:00 - Joe. Stat110 students must be the source of the cheers.

1:12:00 - Prerequisites are basic computer science and statistic courses. CS is comfortable, but stats might not be. Key aspects of stats mentioned: conditioning, random variables, and famous distributions.

1:13:00 - Facets: getting data, storing and managing, exploratory, prediction and communication.

1:17:40 - Frameworks to be used: IPython, pandas, scikit learn, Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib and mrjob. I'll need to pick up scikit learn and mrjob but I'm confident with the rest.

1:18:00 - Talking about homework. I'm keen to find some local datasets that I might be able to replicate homeworks.

1:19:00 - Next stop, readings and homework 0.
