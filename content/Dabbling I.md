Summary: My motivations for seeking to skill up in data science.

Working as a self-trained data journalist for more than a year, I have developed a set of skills and knowledge that allows me to produce just enough data-driven content to earn my paycheck.

Specifically these skills are:

-	knowledge of data sources, 
-	programming data scrapers,
-	proficiency converting and cleaning common data formats,
-	data visualisation including map creation, and
-	frontend development.

What's missing? That elusive soft skill, analysis, and the framework around it to harden it up.

Of course there's analysis bubbling away in most of my work. 'Oow look at the jump in the rate for February'. 'Gee those points are concentrated in that location'. But the extent of hypothesis testing in my work has been limited so far.

So after chatting with an associate, I've decided to seek more formal data analysis skills.

There appear to be many great, free resources available on the web that promise to teach data science, mining and analysis.

I have settled on the [CS109 Data Science course offered by Harvard](http://cs109.org/). All the lectures are published online, it has an extensive reading list, and it uses Python - my programming language of choice.

I look forward to sharing my notes and IPython notebooks about the course in coming weeks and months.
