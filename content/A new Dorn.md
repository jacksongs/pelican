Summary: Why Pelican is best for blogging forever, plus Game of Thrones.

As a journalist, the words, pictures and videos I create are my currency.

In the digital arena words and pictures flitter down news feeds, buried under the weight of the watermarked fight images and reddit-driven nattering.

I have blogged before. On Tumblr. On Wordpress. Heck, I'm even a listed contributor to the most excellent Django-based CMS Mezzanine.

Each platform has proven temporary, so it's time for a change. I'm going to retain a record of all content good enough to publish in Markdown format and publish it using the Python-powered static site generator Pelican. 

I'm going to store it like I would my high school essays, on file, and, like I would my optimistic attempts to create real-time sports data web projects, on Github.

I'm choosing Markdown so I can read it with any editor. It's becoming [more widely accepted in publishing](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=markdown%2C%20microsoft%20word&cmpt=q) after all.

I'm pursuing the python-powered static site generator Pelican for simplicity.

Why static? I didn't want a database, but I still wanted to be able to combine an archive with a web framework. 

Having my life's work on a postgres database on a Digital Ocean, Heroku or Webfaction server somewhere didn't appeal - even if I was disciplined about backups.

On the other hand no one was going to read this post if it was sitting on a folder on my hard drive (apart from government spies).

I'm a Python person, so Pelican made sense. Plus, Pelican has got great integration with iPython Notebooks. Most importantly, peer pressue is powerful, and dudes like [Rob Story](http://wrobstory.github.io/) use it.

And because I need a bit of a traffic leg up, here's a photo of that new dude from Dorne in season four of Game of Thrones:
